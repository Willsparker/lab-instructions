# Dark Launches

A dark launch refers to the practice of deploying a new model or feature in production, but making it invisible or inactive for users. A copy of live traffic directed to the old model, is directed to the new model, providing a safe way to test and validate new changes at scale, without exposing them to end-users.

For machine learning systems, dark launches provide an opportunity to test new models in real-world conditions, monitor their performance, and compare them against the existing model. By routing traffic to both the old and new models without affecting the user experience, teams can ensure that the new model meets expectations before it goes live.

This technique allows teams to:

- Monitor how the new model performs with live traffic.
- Gather insights from real-world data to improve the model further.
- Ensure a smooth, risk-free transition when the new model is ready for production.

Dark launches rely on [Istio Traffic Mirroring](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/mirroring/) capability under the hood. Currently, this is not supported with KServe but it is being worked on by the community. If this is something you are interested in, you can subscribe to [this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/issues/2240) to get the updates.
